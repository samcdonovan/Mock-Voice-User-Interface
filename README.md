# Mock Voice User Interface (Clyde)
Coded a prototype for a voice user interface (VUI) intended to aid programmers. Since this is browser-based, I also created a mock IDE in HTML. The 3 main functions of this VUI are:
- IDE control: User can control the IDE with their voice, e.g. "Clyde change to tab 2" would change the current tab to tab 2.
- Code helper: User can ask Clyde about different sections of code. For example, "Clyde, what does this function do?" and Clyde would respond by reading out the function description, parameters and return type.
